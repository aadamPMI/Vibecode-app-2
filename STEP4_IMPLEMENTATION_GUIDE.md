# Implementation Summary: New Step 4 - Add Exercises to Days

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. **Exercise Library Hook** (`/home/user/workspace/src/hooks/useExerciseLibrary.ts`)
- Provides fuzzy search functionality
- Filters exercises by muscle groups and equipment
- Returns filtered exercise list based on criteria

### 2. **AI Suggestions Hook** (`/home/user/workspace/src/hooks/useAISuggestions.ts`)
- Intelligent exercise recommendations based on:
  - Selected muscle groups from previous steps
  - Split type (push/pull/legs, upper/lower, etc.)
  - Training style (strength, hypertrophy, endurance)
  - User history (frequently used exercises)
- Prioritizes compound lifts (trackE1RM exercises)
- Returns 5-12 top-ranked exercises

### 3. **Step 4 UI Component** (`/home/user/workspace/STEP4_CONTENT.tsx`)
Complete UI implementation including:
- **AI Suggestions Section**: Horizontal scroll of smart recommendations with one-tap add
- **Selected Exercises Panel**: Displays added exercises with:
  - Reorder buttons (move up/down)
  - Remove button
  - Order numbering
- **Exercise Library**:
  - Search bar with live filtering
  - Filtered by muscle groups from current day
  - Shows "Added" badge for already-selected exercises
- **Save Day Button**: Persists changes and returns to day selection

## üìã Integration Steps for ProgramWizardScreen.tsx

### Step 1: Add State Variables
Add this after line 44 (after `selectedDayForExercises` state):

```typescript
// Step 4 - Exercise selection
const [exerciseSearchQuery, setExerciseSearchQuery] = useState('');
```

### Step 2: Add Import
Add this at the top of the file (around line 13):

```typescript
import { EXERCISE_LIBRARY } from '../../constants/exerciseData';
```

### Step 3: Update Step Flow Logic
In the `handleNext` function (around line 80-100), change step 3's transition:

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
} else if (currentStep === 3) {
  // Add mock exercises...
  setCurrentStep(4);
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
} else if (currentStep === 3) {
  // Move to step 4 to add exercises
  setCurrentStep(4);
} else if (currentStep === 4) {
  // Move to step 5 (review)
  setCurrentStep(5);
```

### Step 4: Update handleBack Function
Find `handleBack` and update to handle step 4:

```typescript
const handleBack = () => {
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light);
  if (currentStep === 4 && selectedDayForExercises) {
    // If in exercise picker, go back to day selection
    setSelectedDayForExercises(null);
    setCurrentStep(3);
  } else if (currentStep > 1) {
    setCurrentStep(currentStep - 1);
  } else {
    navigation.goBack();
  }
};
```

### Step 5: Update Step 3 Day Selection
In Step 3 (around line 950-1000), update the day press handler:

**FIND** (in the day card Pressable):
```typescript
onPress={() => {
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium);
  setSelectedDayForExercises(day.id);
}}
```

**CHANGE TO:**
```typescript
onPress={() => {
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium);
  setSelectedDayForExercises(day.id);
  setCurrentStep(4); // Move to exercise selection
}}
```

### Step 6: Insert New Step 4
**INSERT THE ENTIRE CONTENT FROM** `/home/user/workspace/STEP4_CONTENT.tsx`

**LOCATION**: After line 1094 (after Step 3 closes), before Step 4 (current review page)

The file already contains the complete JSX with all functionality.

### Step 7: Update Current Step 4 to Step 5
Find the current Step 4 (Review Program) around line 1096:

**CHANGE:**
```typescript
{/* Step 4 - Review Program */}
{currentStep === 4 && (
```

**TO:**
```typescript
{/* Step 5 - Review Program */}
{currentStep === 5 && (
```

### Step 8: Update Progress Indicators
Find the progress indicators at the top (around line 200-250) and add a 5th step indicator:

```typescript
{/* Progress Steps */}
<View className="flex-row items-center justify-between px-6 mb-6">
  {[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map((step) => (
    <View key={step} className="flex-1 items-center">
      {/* ... existing step indicator code ... */}
    </View>
  ))}
</View>
```

### Step 9: Update Bottom Navigation Buttons
Update the Next button logic (around line 1200-1280) to handle the new step 5:

**IN THE NEXT BUTTON PRESSABLE:**
```typescript
onPress={currentStep === 5 ? () => {
  // Create & Activate logic
  Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Success);
  navigation.goBack();
} : handleNext}
```

**IN THE BUTTON TEXT:**
```typescript
{currentStep === 5 ? (
  <>
    <Ionicons name="checkmark-circle" size={20} color="white" />
    <Text className="text-white font-bold ml-2">
      Create & Activate
    </Text>
  </>
) : (
  // ... existing Next button content
)}
```
